              Advertisements displayed, Collection and use of information
            </h2>

            <p>
              Once the "SmartTorch" and/or the "SmarTorch" app is installed, it
              contains Google Admob Advertisements. These ads will not prevent
              users from using the app, as they are only situated at either the
              bottom of the screen or the top of the screen.<br /><br />

              In order to display advertisements in the interest of users,
              "SmartTorch" and "SmarTorch" uses the third-party service Google
              Admob which collects the user's Advertising ID.<br /><br />
              Please refer to the
              <a href="https://support.google.com/admob/answer/6128543?hl=en"
                >AdMob policies and restrictions</a
              >.
            </p>

            <h2 class="featurette-heading">In-app purchase | Subscriptions</h2>
            <p>
              In case you are using "SmartTorch" and you don't want to see ads
              in the app anymore, you are given the option from within the app
              to either make a lifetime in-app purchase or purchase a monthly or
              yearly suscription through Google Play Store, to stop seeing ads
              in the app. Payment of this fee is handled by Google Play Store.
              <br /><br />
              If even after you made that in-app purchase or purchased the
              suscription through the Google Play Store the Ads are still being
              displayed to you in the app, send us an e-mail with screenshots
              showing that problem at: germainkevinbusiness@gmail.com, so that
              we can address the matter.
            </p>
